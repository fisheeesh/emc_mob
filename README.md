## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (3.9.2 or higher)
- Dart SDK
- Android Studio / Xcode (for mobile development)
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fisheeesh/emc_mob.git
   cd emc_mob
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Configure API endpoints**
   
   Update the API URLs in `lib/utils/constants/urls.dart`:
   ```dart
   static const String PROD_URL = "https://your-api-domain.com";
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   # For development
   flutter run
   
   # For production build
   flutter build apk  # Android
   flutter build ios  # iOS
   ```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### State Management
The app uses the **Provider** pattern for state management, with separate providers for:
- **LoginProvider**: Authentication and user session
- **CheckInProvider**: Emotion check-in operations
- **EmotionProvider**: Emotion categories and data
- **EmployeeProvider**: Employee profile management

### Data Flow
1. **Login**: User authenticates → Tokens stored securely → Navigate to Home
2. **Check-in**: Select emotion → Add notes → Submit to API → Store locally
3. **Sync**: App fetches latest data → Updates local DB → Refreshes UI
4. **Offline**: All operations work offline → Auto-sync when connection restored

### Local Database Schema

**checkins table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE checkins (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  emoji TEXT NOT NULL,
  textFeeling TEXT NOT NULL,
  createdAt TEXT NOT NULL,
  checkInTime TEXT NOT NULL
)
```

## 🌐 API Integration

### Authentication Endpoints
```
POST /api/v1/login
```

### User Endpoints
```
GET  /api/v1/user/my-history
POST /api/v1/user/check-in
GET  /api/v1/user/emotion-categories
GET  /api/v1/user/emp-data
PATCH /api/v1/user/emp-data
```

### Request Headers
```
Authorization: Bearer {access_token}
x-refresh-token: {refresh_token}
x-platform: mobile
Content-Type: application/json
```

## 📊 Offline Functionality

The app is designed to work seamlessly offline:

1. **Check-ins**: Stored locally in SQLite
2. **Emotions**: Cached with 24-hour refresh
3. **Profile**: Cached locally
4. **Sync**: Automatic background sync when online

### Cache Strategy
- Emotion categories cached for 24 hours
- Fallback data available if API fails
- Manual refresh available via pull-to-refresh

## 📦 Building for Production

### Android
```bash
# Generate release APK
flutter build apk --release

# Generate App Bundle (recommended for Play Store)
flutter build appbundle --release
```

### iOS
```bash
# Build for iOS
flutter build ios --release

# Create archive in Xcode
open ios/Runner.xcworkspace
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### API Configuration
Update the API URLs in `lib/utils/constants/urls.dart`:

```dart
// Development URLs
static const String ANDROID_BASE_URL = "https://10.0.2.2:8080";
static const String IOS_BASE_URL = "https://192.168.1.185:8080";

// Production URL
static const String PROD_URL = "https://api.your-domain.com";
```

**Note**: 
- Android emulator uses `10.0.2.2` to access localhost on the host machine
- iOS simulator uses your local network IP address
- Update `PROD_URL` with your actual production API domain

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: App crashes on startup
- **Solution**: Clear app data and reinstall

**Issue**: Login fails with network error
- **Solution**: Check API URL configuration in `urls.dart`

**Issue**: Images not loading
- **Solution**: Verify network permissions in AndroidManifest.xml

**Issue**: Token refresh fails
- **Solution**: Backend auth middleware must return new tokens in headers
